# Predicting-Home-Run-Outcomes-Using-Statcast-Data
For this project, I used MLB Statcast data from the 2021 season to classify home run events (dataset linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/s903124/mlb-statcast-data?select=Statcast_2021.csv). This dataset contained 93 features and 709,851 rows worth of data. To accomplish this, I created three different machine learning models: a logisitic regression model, a decision tree model, and a random forest model. I compared the performance of each of these models to identify which one performed the best based on four model evaluation metrics: true positive rate (TPR), positive predictive value (PPV), f1_score (F1), and area under the curve (AUC).
